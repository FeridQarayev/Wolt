            <h3>What is this Wolt thing anyway?</h3><br>
            <p>Founded in Helsinki, we are a technology company known for our local commerce platform. Wolt's mission is
              to make cities better places for customers, merchants and couriers alike. Wolt's platform makes it easy
              for customers to order whatever they need on one app, for merchants to make additional sales, and for
              couriers to make meaningful earnings flexibly. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies
              from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions, as well as operates its own grocery
              stores under the brand Wolt Market. <br>
              <br>
              In November 2021, we announced that we’re joining forces with the US-based company DoorDash. The
              transaction closed in May 2022, and since then we have been one team with DoorDash. Our CEO, Miki Kuusi
              leads all of DoorDash’s international business in the 26 countries outside of the US.
              <br>
              <br>
              Together our aim is to build the best possible platform to serve merchants, consumers, and couriers in our
              existing and future markets. Our two companies share a strong vision for local commerce, and working side
              by side, we can accomplish more for all our stakeholders.

            <h3>Companies usually have a “mission and vision”. What are ours?</h3><br>
            <p>Wolt is – essentially – building new infrastructure. We build a connection between restaurants and
              retailers that want to make and sell food and other products, couriers that want to earn through
              delivering those products, and customers who want to free up time and effort to focus on the more
              important things in life. By doing this, we make our cities also better places to live. And by “better” we
              mean happier people: happier small enterprises that have more business and that can employ more people,
              happier couriers that have a flexible way to earn when they choose, happier customers who now have easy
              access to a great meal or anything else they need, exactly when and where they need it - and who get to
              save some of their precious time while they are at it.
              <br> <br>
              Our vision is to build the digital world version of the shopping malls we used to frequent, this time
              brought to the convenience of our homes and workplaces within the half-hour or so. We started with the
              food court on top the floor, and have since expanded to groceries on the ground floor along with all the
              other shops, stores and boutiques in the middle – <i>and we’re still only getting started.</i>

      <h1>How about the journey so far, how has it been?</h1>
      <h3>2014: Wolt was founded in Helsinki, Finland</h3>

      <div class="ul--text">
        <ul>
          <li>Founding team of six with five focused on product development</li>
          <li>Our first office was a 10-square-meter space in central Helsinki where we all worked together in one room
            for the first 9 months of our existence.</li>
          <li>We decided the name of the company and filed all the paperwork. Wolt was the final name we were all able
            to agree on. One of our founders, Mika, was browsing through a list of imaginary punk band names and “Volt
            United” ultimately turned into Wolt. (Name contenders included amazing options like Blueberry Pie, Skyliner,
            Zaplane and Sergei). </li>
          <li>This was also the year of the Sochi Olympics.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>2015: Our first delivery in Helsinki!</h3>

      <div class="ul--text">
        <ul>
          <li>14 employees by the end of September</li>
          <li>We moved to a bigger office in Ruoholahti, just downstairs from the Supercell office. We even had the
            Apple chief of the App Store visit our office just after we’ve launched, as courtesy of Supercell. We were
            probably the smallest app maker they’d ever visited (and they didn’t disagree).</li>
          <li>We raised a 2.5 million euro seed round of financing. </li>
          <li>This was also the year Star Wars the Force Awakens had its premier.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>2016: Expansion to Sweden and Estonia</h3>
      <div class="ul--text">
        <ul>
          <li>60 employees by end of September</li>
          <li>We opened an office in Stockholm, hurraa! We also expanded into our first cities outside of Helsinki – the
            cities of Turku and Tampere in Finland.</li>
          <li>We raised 10 million euros in the so-called A-round of financing. The round was led by EQT Ventures.
          </li>
          <li>This was also the year that Stranger Things premiered.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>2017: Expansion to Denmark, Latvia and Lithuania</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>86 employees by end of September</li>
          <li>We replaced third party tools with in-house created courier apps and our own logistics backend. </li>
          <li>Adele won the Grammy for Album of the Year. </li>
          
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>2018: Expansion to Croatia, Czech Republic, Norway, Hungary, Georgia, Israel and Poland</h3>
      <div class="ul--text">
        <ul>
          <li>223 employees by end of September</li>
          <li>We entered hypergrowth and went from 100 to 300 people (by end-of-year) at our offices</li>
          <li>We raised a 27 million euro B-round of financing. The round was led by 83North. </li>
          <li>The premiere of the Black Panther movie.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>2019: Expansion to Serbia, Greece, Azerbaijan, Slovakia, Slovenia and Kazakhstan</h3>
      <div class="ul--text">
        <ul>
          <li>569 employees by end of September </li>
          <li>We partnered with South Pole to compensate for the CO2 emissions from Wolt deliveries (dating all the way back to the first delivery) </li>
          <li>We raised 115 million euros in a so-called C-round, led by ICONIQ Capital and Highland Europe.</li>
          <li>Also the year of the Game of Thrones final season.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>2020: Expansion to Cyprus, Malta, Japan and Germany</h3>
      <div class="ul--text">
        <ul>
          <li>1430 employees by end of September</li>
          <li>We added grocery and retail into the Wolt app. We took action to keep ordering on Wolt as safe as possible, e.g. deliveries as no-contact.</li>
          <li>We raised €100 Million from existing investors and Goldman Sachs Growth Equity and €7.5 Million from Delivery Hero’s co-founder Lukasz Gadowski</li>
          <li>We became a unicorn, yey!</li>
          <li>The year of the Covid-19 pandemic.</li>

      <div class="ul--text">
        <ul>
          <li>3740 employees by end of September</li>
          <li>We doubled down on retail and onboarded new partners, developed new tooling for the merchants, like Wolt Picker App, and accelerated our plans with our delivery-only stores, Wolt Market. We raised $530 million in financing. ICONIQ Growth led the round while Tiger Global, DST, KKR, Prosus, EQT Growth and Coatue joined as new investors. 83North, Highland Europe, Goldman Sachs Growth Equity, EQT Ventures and Vintage Investment Partners from Wolt’s existing investors also participated in the round.</li>
          <li>We entered a definitive agreement whereby DoorDash and Wolt were joining forces, resulting in the transaction that was closed in May 2022.</li>
          <li>This was the year the Summer Olympics of 2020 took place in Tokyo, after being postponed due to the pandemic.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>2022: Joining forces to serve customers across the globe</h3>

      <h3 class="topcard_text_h3">So, yet another food delivery company?</h3>
      <p class="topcard_text_p">Actually not quite. Wolt got started on the far edge of the Scandinavian
        Peninsula, in the relatively small and spread out city of Helsinki. While Finland is a <a
          href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/finland-happiest-country-united-nations-world-happiness-report-a9414201.html"
          class="topcard_text_p_a">great country to live in</a>,
        food delivery was an especially tough nut to crack in our Nordic home region:</p>
      <ul class="topcard_text_ul">
        <li class="topcard_text_ul_li"><strong class="topcard_text_ul_li_str">Low density:</strong>
          Helsinki has a population of about 630 000
          people, who are
          spread out across 213,8km. That means there’s on average 2946 people on each square kilometer. (As a
          comparison,
          in Paris there’s about 20 370 people per square kilometer.) So we are a few and we are far apart. This means
          that we’ll never quite get the volume nor density that makes the food delivery problem much easier to solve
          with
          a high level of efficiency. Meanwhile, the smallest cities we operate in today have as few as 10 000 people
          living in our delivery area.</li>
        <li class="topcard_text_ul_li">We don’t really have a strong <strong class="topcard_text_ul_li_str">takeaway
            culture</strong> nor is
          delivery a very
          everyday thing in our Northern home region. For context, most restaurants that offer delivery themselves as a
          service often trade in pizza or kebab. This was not a very fruitful ground to build a completely new delivery
          experience on top of.</li>
        <li class="topcard_text_ul_li"><strong class="topcard_text_ul_li_str">Lowest income disparity
          </strong> in the world along with very
          <strong class="topcard_text_ul_li_str">high labour costs</strong> for
          any type of work. This combined with high price sensitivity means that our delivery fee and commission revenue
          are going to be relatively lower than virtually any other markets in the world compared to how much we need to
          be able to get to as courier earnings on an hourly basis (to cover not just the earnings but also all
          associated
          delivery cost, pensions and such).

      <p class="middle_text_p">All in all, these mean that our home market of the Nordics was one of the toughest
        places in the world to find
        a sustainable balance between our customers, restaurants and courier partners, as well as with ourselves as a
        company. Ultimately, this has meant that we’ve had to figure out ways how to get there differently from others:
      </p>
      <ul class="middle_text_ul">
        <li class="middle_text_ul_li"><strong class="middle_text_ul_li_str">Technology</strong> – real-time traveling
          salesman optimisation with as many moving pieces, hungry customers and busy restaurants as we have is a
          genuinely difficult mathematical problem to solve, not even talking about how to balance real-time
          delivery estimates, traffic situations, order volumes and human behaviour in a way that get the customer’s
          order delivery as quickly and precisely as possible, while actually making it worthwhile for all the
          counterparties in the equation. While this is something that we still constantly work on, our average
          delivery time remains at 30-35 minutes, and we’re always looking to do better.</li>
        <li class="middle_text_ul_li"><strong class="middle_text_ul_li_str">Efficiency</strong> – our local country
          teams run the show in each of the markets we
          operate in, while we operate in relatively small countries and always with real-time customer support in local
          language. This means that we’ve had to become especially good in being able to productize and automate
          everything to the extent that it’s possible to have local teams in countries as small as one million people,
          and still get the numbers to work. This allows us to operate sustainably in cities as small as 10 000 people
          living in our delivery area.</li>
        <li class="middle_text_ul_li"><strong class="middle_text_ul_li_str">Customer</strong> experience – ultimately
          we have no license to operate if we do not serve
          the customer in a brilliant, affordable way end-to-end: from app design and marketing to our real-time
          customer service, we do our best for you to be happy with us. And if something goes wrong, we genuinely want
          to fix it. That’s why we have local customer support in all the countries we’re in: real humans answering
          customers and partners in their own language in under 1 minute on average. </li>
