            <h3>What is this Wolt thing anyway?</h3><br>
            <p>Founded in Helsinki, we are a technology company known for our local commerce platform. Wolt's mission is
              to make cities better places for customers, merchants and couriers alike. Wolt's platform makes it easy
              for customers to order whatever they need on one app, for merchants to make additional sales, and for
              couriers to make meaningful earnings flexibly. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies
              from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions, as well as operates its own grocery
              stores under the brand Wolt Market. <br>
              <br>
              In November 2021, we announced that we’re joining forces with the US-based company DoorDash. The
              transaction closed in May 2022, and since then we have been one team with DoorDash. Our CEO, Miki Kuusi
              leads all of DoorDash’s international business in the 26 countries outside of the US.
              <br>
              <br>
              Together our aim is to build the best possible platform to serve merchants, consumers, and couriers in our
              existing and future markets. Our two companies share a strong vision for local commerce, and working side
              by side, we can accomplish more for all our stakeholders.

            <h3>Companies usually have a “mission and vision”. What are ours?</h3><br>
            <p>Wolt is – essentially – building new infrastructure. We build a connection between restaurants and
              retailers that want to make and sell food and other products, couriers that want to earn through
              delivering those products, and customers who want to free up time and effort to focus on the more
              important things in life. By doing this, we make our cities also better places to live. And by “better” we
              mean happier people: happier small enterprises that have more business and that can employ more people,
              happier couriers that have a flexible way to earn when they choose, happier customers who now have easy
              access to a great meal or anything else they need, exactly when and where they need it - and who get to
              save some of their precious time while they are at it.
              <br> <br>
              Our vision is to build the digital world version of the shopping malls we used to frequent, this time
              brought to the convenience of our homes and workplaces within the half-hour or so. We started with the
              food court on top the floor, and have since expanded to groceries on the ground floor along with all the
              other shops, stores and boutiques in the middle – <i>and we’re still only getting started.</i>
