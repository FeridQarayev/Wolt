      <h3 class="topcard_text_h3">So, yet another food delivery company?</h3>
      <p class="topcard_text_p">Actually not quite. Wolt got started on the far edge of the Scandinavian
        Peninsula, in the relatively small and spread out city of Helsinki. While Finland is a <a
          href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/finland-happiest-country-united-nations-world-happiness-report-a9414201.html"
          class="topcard_text_p_a">great country to live in</a>,
        food delivery was an especially tough nut to crack in our Nordic home region:</p>
      <ul class="topcard_text_ul">
        <li class="topcard_text_ul_li"><strong class="topcard_text_ul_li_str">Low density:</strong>
          Helsinki has a population of about 630 000
          people, who are
          spread out across 213,8km. That means there’s on average 2946 people on each square kilometer. (As a
          comparison,
          in Paris there’s about 20 370 people per square kilometer.) So we are a few and we are far apart. This means
          that we’ll never quite get the volume nor density that makes the food delivery problem much easier to solve
          with
          a high level of efficiency. Meanwhile, the smallest cities we operate in today have as few as 10 000 people
          living in our delivery area.</li>
        <li class="topcard_text_ul_li">We don’t really have a strong <strong class="topcard_text_ul_li_str">takeaway
            culture</strong> nor is
          delivery a very
          everyday thing in our Northern home region. For context, most restaurants that offer delivery themselves as a
          service often trade in pizza or kebab. This was not a very fruitful ground to build a completely new delivery
          experience on top of.</li>
        <li class="topcard_text_ul_li"><strong class="topcard_text_ul_li_str">Lowest income disparity
          </strong> in the world along with very
          <strong class="topcard_text_ul_li_str">high labour costs</strong> for
          any type of work. This combined with high price sensitivity means that our delivery fee and commission revenue
          are going to be relatively lower than virtually any other markets in the world compared to how much we need to
          be able to get to as courier earnings on an hourly basis (to cover not just the earnings but also all
          associated
          delivery cost, pensions and such).

      <p class="middle_text_p">All in all, these mean that our home market of the Nordics was one of the toughest
        places in the world to find
        a sustainable balance between our customers, restaurants and courier partners, as well as with ourselves as a
        company. Ultimately, this has meant that we’ve had to figure out ways how to get there differently from others:
      </p>
      <ul class="middle_text_ul">
        <li class="middle_text_ul_li"><strong class="middle_text_ul_li_str">Technology</strong> – real-time traveling
          salesman optimisation with as many moving pieces, hungry customers and busy restaurants as we have is a
          genuinely difficult mathematical problem to solve, not even talking about how to balance real-time
          delivery estimates, traffic situations, order volumes and human behaviour in a way that get the customer’s
          order delivery as quickly and precisely as possible, while actually making it worthwhile for all the
          counterparties in the equation. While this is something that we still constantly work on, our average
          delivery time remains at 30-35 minutes, and we’re always looking to do better.</li>
        <li class="middle_text_ul_li"><strong class="middle_text_ul_li_str">Efficiency</strong> – our local country
          teams run the show in each of the markets we
          operate in, while we operate in relatively small countries and always with real-time customer support in local
          language. This means that we’ve had to become especially good in being able to productize and automate
          everything to the extent that it’s possible to have local teams in countries as small as one million people,
          and still get the numbers to work. This allows us to operate sustainably in cities as small as 10 000 people
          living in our delivery area.</li>
        <li class="middle_text_ul_li"><strong class="middle_text_ul_li_str">Customer</strong> experience – ultimately
          we have no license to operate if we do not serve
          the customer in a brilliant, affordable way end-to-end: from app design and marketing to our real-time
          customer service, we do our best for you to be happy with us. And if something goes wrong, we genuinely want
          to fix it. That’s why we have local customer support in all the countries we’re in: real humans answering
          customers and partners in their own language in under 1 minute on average. </li>

      <h3 class="bottom_text_h3">What operating sustainably and finding the right balance means for us?</h3>
      <p class="bottom_text_p">We are committed to make the cities we operate in better places to live. We are also
        committed to do the right thing towards our teammates, partners, customers, and the general public. More
        concretely what that means:</p>
      <ul class="bottom_text_ul">

          being a
          great company to work for.
          We treat each
          other fairly, we promote equal opportunities and encourage diversity. We take pride in what people of Wolt do
          not just during their time with the company, but also the impact they will create in their future endeavours
          after Wolt.</li>
        <li class="bottom_text_ul_li"><strong class="bottom_text_ul_li_str">Couriers</strong> – We’re committed to being

          fair and sustainable
          platform. We treat our courier partners with respect. We always listen to feedback and regularly survey how
          our
          couriers are doing. We take pride in trying to increase earnings, introduce safety nets and remove hindrances
          as
          we continue growing and investing into making our products and technologies better.</li>

          being a
          long-term partner. Through
          our service, we bring restaurants more orders, and we’re always helpful and responsive. We strive to find a
          long-term sustainable balance between our and the merchant's business in each of the cities we operate in.
