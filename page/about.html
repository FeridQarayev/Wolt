      <p class="topcard_text_p">Actually not quite. Wolt got started on the far edge of the Scandinavian
        Peninsula, in the relatively small and spread out city of Helsinki. While Finland is a <a

          class="topcard_text_p_a">great country to live in</a>,
        food delivery was an especially tough nut to crack in our Nordic home region:</p>
      <ul class="topcard_text_ul">
        <li class="topcard_text_ul_li"><strong class="topcard_text_ul_li_str">Low density:</strong>
          Helsinki has a population of about 630 000
          people, who are
          spread out across 213,8km. That means there’s on average 2946 people on each square kilometer. (As a
          comparison,
          in Paris there’s about 20 370 people per square kilometer.) So we are a few and we are far apart. This means
          that we’ll never quite get the volume nor density that makes the food delivery problem much easier to solve
          with
          a high level of efficiency. Meanwhile, the smallest cities we operate in today have as few as 10 000 people
          living in our delivery area.</li>
        <li class="topcard_text_ul_li">We don’t really have a strong <strong class="topcard_text_ul_li_str">takeaway
            culture</strong> nor is
          delivery a very
          everyday thing in our Northern home region. For context, most restaurants that offer delivery themselves as a
          service often trade in pizza or kebab. This was not a very fruitful ground to build a completely new delivery
          experience on top of.</li>
        <li class="topcard_text_ul_li"><strong class="topcard_text_ul_li_str">Lowest income disparity
          </strong> in the world along with very
          <strong class="topcard_text_ul_li_str">high labour costs</strong> for
          any type of work. This combined with high price sensitivity means that our delivery fee and commission revenue
          are going to be relatively lower than virtually any other markets in the world compared to how much we need to
          be able to get to as courier earnings on an hourly basis (to cover not just the earnings but also all
          associated
          delivery cost, pensions and such).
