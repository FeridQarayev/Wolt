      <h1>How about the journey so far, how has it been?</h1>
      <h3>2014: Wolt was founded in Helsinki, Finland</h3>

      <div class="ul--text">
        <ul>
          <li>Founding team of six with five focused on product development</li>
          <li>Our first office was a 10-square-meter space in central Helsinki where we all worked together in one room
            for the first 9 months of our existence.</li>
          <li>We decided the name of the company and filed all the paperwork. Wolt was the final name we were all able
            to agree on. One of our founders, Mika, was browsing through a list of imaginary punk band names and “Volt
            United” ultimately turned into Wolt. (Name contenders included amazing options like Blueberry Pie, Skyliner,
            Zaplane and Sergei). </li>
          <li>This was also the year of the Sochi Olympics.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>14 employees by the end of September</li>
          <li>We moved to a bigger office in Ruoholahti, just downstairs from the Supercell office. We even had the
            Apple chief of the App Store visit our office just after we’ve launched, as courtesy of Supercell. We were
            probably the smallest app maker they’d ever visited (and they didn’t disagree).</li>
          <li>We raised a 2.5 million euro seed round of financing. </li>
          <li>This was also the year Star Wars the Force Awakens had its premier.</li>
        </ul>
